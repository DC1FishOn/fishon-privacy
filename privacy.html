  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 2025</p>

  <p><strong>FishOn</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you use FishOn, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect your device’s location to show catches on the map and allow you to add new ones near you.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> You may choose to attach photos of your catches. These images are stored only on your device and are not uploaded to any cloud service.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect basic device data such as model and operating system version for performance and diagnostics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your data is used solely to enhance your experience within the FishOn app. For example:</p>

    Your data is not visible to other users and is not linked to your identity. Optional sign-in or authentication features may be added in future versions, but are not currently available.
    Future premium features may offer access to aggregated or global catch data, without exposing any personal or identifiable information.
